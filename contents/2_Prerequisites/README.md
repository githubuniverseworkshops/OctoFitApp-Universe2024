# Prerequisites, expectations, and assumptions

## Prerequisites for attendees
- GitHub Copilot license 
- Primary IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Plugins installed
- Operating System: Shouldnâ€™t matter
- GitHub Account

## Technology stacks
- NodeJS: Version xxx
- ReactJS: Version xxx
- Python Django: Version xxx

## Expectations

By the end of this guide, you will be expected to build a full stack application. However, due to some technical difficulties, it is likely that you will not be able to build everything in 40 minutes. However, you will still have a guide at the end to try on your own.

## Assumptions

Two approaches:
Ask Copilot to generate a lot of boiler plate codes first time:
PROS: Create a lot of structures that we probably need later
CONS: Probably need to make a bunch of changes to make it work. Hard to make it into a tutorial.
Good for: When you actually work for the real project
Bad for: Make it a tutorial like format
Ask Copilot to make incremental, graduate changes
PROS: More predictable and easy to make it procedural steps
CONS: Can take more time and strategy later
Good for: Tutorial
Bad for: Real project

We will choose the second approach because we want to make it a more procedural step-by-step approach.
