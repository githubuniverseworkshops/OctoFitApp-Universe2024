## OctoFit Tracker: Building a Fitness App with GitHub Copilot

Welcome to the OctoFit Tracker app workshop! In this hands-on session, you'll step into the shoes of a lead developer tasked with creating a cutting-edge fitness tracker app in record time. We'll leverage the power of GitHub Copilot to rapidly develop a functional prototype of OctoFit Tracker, a social fitness app that encourages users to stay active and compete with their peers.

### Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you'll:

1. Set up a development environment using GitHub Codespaces
2. Use GitHub Copilot to accelerate development across multiple technologies
3. Build key components of the OctoFit Tracker app
4. Learn best practices and prompting techniques for working with GitHub Copilot

### Application Features

OctoFit Tracker will include:

- User authentication and profiles
- Activity logging and tracking
- Team creation and management
- Competitive leader boards
- Personalized workout suggestions

### GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat

GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat uses OpenAI GPT models for its coding suggestions and chat interaction.
OpenAI gpt-4o: *"Our high-intelligence flagship model for complex, multi-step tasks. GPT-4o is cheaper and faster than GPT-4 Turbo. Currently points to gpt-4o-2024-08-06"*
