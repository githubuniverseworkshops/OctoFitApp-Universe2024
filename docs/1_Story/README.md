## OctoFit Tracker: Building a Fitness App with GitHub Copilot

Welcome to the **OctoFit Tracker** app workshop! In this hands-on session, you'll step into the shoes of a lead developer tasked with creating a cutting-edge fitness tracker app in record time. We'll leverage the power of **GitHub Copilot** to rapidly develop a functional prototype of **OctoFit Tracker**, a social fitness app that encourages users to stay active and to compete with their peers.

### Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you'll:

1. Set up a development environment using **GitHub Codespaces**
2. Use **GitHub Copilot** to accelerate development across multiple technologies
3. Build key components of the **OctoFit Tracker** app
4. Learn best practices and prompting techniques for working with **GitHub Copilot**

> :blue_book: **NOTE**: Because we have only 20 minutes for the actual workshop, it is possible that we cannot complete everything. However, we will have the value of troubleshooting together, and there is also a [self-paced exercise - Coming Soon!](https://gh.io/octofit-tutorial) if you want to follow along later.

### Application Features

**OctoFit Tracker** will include:

- User authentication and profiles
- Activity logging and tracking
- Team creation and management
- A competitive leaderboard
- Personalized workout suggestions

### GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat

GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat uses OpenAI GPT models for its coding suggestions and chat interaction.
