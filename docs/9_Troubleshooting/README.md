  <summary>I am getting a following error when I try to connect the front end with REST API endpoint generated with backend: Access to XMLHttpRequest has been blocked by CORS policy</summary>
  This is a common issue when you are trying to connect the front end with the REST API endpoint. Codespace almost exclusively through VS Code and things like port-forwarding work a lot better. Although you can follow the steps in the workshop, you might find it much easier to switch to your local environment through VS Code. If you are still having issues, please reach out to the GitHub.

  <summary>Why is this not utilizing Copilot Worspace?</summary>
  Copilot Workspace is a new GitHub feature that helps to bootstrap a lot of boilerplate codes and generating resources within the repository. We could have started with **Copilot Workspace** but we wanted to show you how to use Copilot in a more traditional way. If you are interested in learning more about Copilot Workspace, please check out the documentation:https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-workspace.

<details>
  <summary>Would I have a same experience if I try this through an IDE?</summary>
  For the most part, yes. Codespace uses the same editor as Visual Studio Code, so you should have the same experience. However, there are some features that are only available in Codespace, such as the ability to run the code in the cloud. And you might encounter issue with CORS. If you are having issues, please reach out to the GitHub.
