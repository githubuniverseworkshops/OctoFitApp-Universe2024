# Getting started - app frontend and backend creation

In this section, we will start by setting up the face of our OctoFit application by building the front end page. To do that, we will keep it as simple as possible for now. We need resources like HTML and CSS to start decorating first, and we will later modify the page to extend the functionalities.

## Explain to GitHub Copilot the goals and steps

It is important to lay out a plan, provide details, and be specific.</br>

I want to build an OctoFit Tracker app that will include the following:

* User authentication and profiles
* Activity logging and tracking
* Team creation and management
* Competitive leader boards
* Personalized workout suggestions

It should be in one app

generate instructions in this order

1. Create the frontend and backend in the octofit-tracker directory of this repository in one command
2. Setup backend python venv and install octofit-tracker/requirements.txt first
3. The octofit-tracker/backend directory will store the django project and app with the name octofit-tracker
4. The Django project octofit-tracker directory will have all the backend components for the app
5. Create the django app directly in the directory octofit_tracker/backend
6. Setup the octofit-tracker/frontend directory will store the react app with no subdirectories
7. Install bootstrap and import it
8. Install mongodb via 'apt-get' and setup mongodb with the 'sudo service mongodb start' and 'sudo service mongodb status'

Tha directory tree for the OctoFit Tracker App

octofit-tracker/
├── backend/
│   ├── venv/
│   ├── octofit_tracker/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── models.py
│   │   ├── serializers.py
│   │   ├── settings.py
│   │   ├── views.py
│   │   ├── urls.py
│   │   ├── wsgi.py
│   │   └── asgi.py
└── frontend/
    ├── node_modules/
    ├── public/
    ├── src/
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

All of the backend django app will be in octofit_tracker and do NOT create another app of any kind

Use a Python virtual environment and install all python dependencies from file octofit-tracker/requirements.txt in this workspace

The octofit-tracker/requirements.txt already contains all Django requirements. Django, djongo, sqlparse

Layout the directory structure with no redundant backend and frontend subdirectories

Use bootstrap for the frontend

Let's think about this step by step

Important to avoid using public code and we do NOT need to initialize the git repository
